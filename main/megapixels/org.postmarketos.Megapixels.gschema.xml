      <description>
        Megapixels will write a .dng file that's passed to the post processing script
        if this setting is disabled the post-process script will be told to clean it
        up after processing.

      <description>
        When set this will define the absolute path to a postprocessor to use after
        taking a picture. When empty megapixels will default to the legacy
        postprocess.sh lookup
